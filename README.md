## Usage

### Adding new certificate

Go to `https://YOUR-FUNCTIONS.azurewebsites.net/add-certificate`. Since the Web UI is displayed, if you select the target DNS zone and input domain and execute it, a certificate will be issued.

If nothing is displayed in the dropdown, the IAM setting is incorrect.

### App Service (Web Apps / Functions / Containers)

Select "Import Key Vault Certificate" button to import the certificate from Key Vault into App Service.
